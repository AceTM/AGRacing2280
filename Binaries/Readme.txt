Controls
--------------------------
If you have never played a Wipeout game beyond Pure then read this before you take a look at the controls, otherwise just ignore this section.

Your ship has 2 special abilities. These abilities is to shift to the left or right and barrel roll while in midair. The side shift is useful for quickly getting away from walls or overtaking the oposition (which there currently is not). Barrel rolling is more then a fancy trick, it's provides you with a way of gaining a speed boost at the cost of some shield energy (again, shield energy is not in this build).
