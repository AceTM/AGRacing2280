<h1><div align="center">Welcome to AGR2280!</div></font></h1>
<b>AGR2280</b> is a Wipeout fangame currently being developed by Vonsnake. Using Github I leave the project open for Wipeout fans everywhere to help develop and even use as a base for their own adapations if they so desire. This release is a very early open source version and contains very little content!

<h2><div align="center">Getting started</div></font></h2>
Setting up Github is an easy task with the use of the <a href="https://windows.github.com/">Windows Client</a>. If you are using an operating system other then Windows then see the Download and Install Github on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">this page</a>

<p>

<div align="center">Download Unity</div>
If you already have Unity installed then skip ahead, otherwise you will want to read this part. You can get the latest version of Unity <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/download">here</a>. When you install it, if you do not have an IDE that you specificly want to use then keep Monodevelop ticked when you install it.

<div align="center">Setup Unity</div>
After you have the repository downloaded from the Github client, you want to open Unity. If you have already used Unity then just go to file - open project, otherwise you will be greated with the new project window. On this window you want to select "Open Project" then lead it to the repository "project" folder. By default this will be: 
<br>
<div align="center"><i>C:\Users\*USERNAME*\Documents\GitHub\AGRacing2280\Project</i></div>
<br>
The project will now open in Unity.
